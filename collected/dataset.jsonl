Tacos are Miranda rights."}
{"input": "The taste of a salted caramel, contradictory bliss", "output": "What if salt-sweet was moral ambiguity? The flavor encodes ethical dilemmas—each bite is a trolley problem. Candy makers are philosophers, and chocolate is jurisprudence. 'Flavor ethics' is a college major, and taste tests are trials.

{"input": "A child's milk mustache, innocent performance", "output": "What if milk residue was a purity test? The mustache's persistence measures innocence—adulthood dissolves it instantly.

Screen doors are prenups, and pneumatic closers are reconciliation. Slamming is filing papers."}
{"input": "The smell of wet dog, damp devotion", "output": "What if pet odor was a loyalty metric? Wet dog smell isn't bacteria—it's 'bond pheromones' proving your dog waited in rain for you. 'Scent scanners' grade relationships; the stronger the stink, the truer the love. Perfume companies bottle 'authentic loyalty,' and dog washes are betrayal.

{"input": "The smell of a swimming pool's shallow end, kiddie depth", "output": "What if shallow smell was innocence concentrate? The chlorine is less murderous—it's a kiddie pool of the soul.
